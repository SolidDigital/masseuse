* The start method now runs its life cycle methods synchronously if all defined methods are synchronous.
    * No code has to be updated for this, but it allows certain simplifications, for example:

        ```javascript
        synchronousView
            .start()
            .done(function() {
                doSomethingThatReliesOnTheViewBeingStarted();
            });
        ```

    * can now optionally be simplified to synchronous code:

        ```javascript
        synchronousView
            .start();
        doSomethingThatReliesOnTheViewBeingStarted();
        ```
