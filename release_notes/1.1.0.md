* new features
    * added a new life cycle event, `afterRenderingDone` that happens once the template is compile, but before the element is inserted into the DOM
    * lifecycle events are now triggered on the view itself in addition to notifying through the promise returned from start
    * the rivets configs now use plural but are backward compatible to singular on options
        * `options.rivetsBinders` - `options.rivetBinders` both work - singular also works for all below
        * `options.rivetsConfig`
        * `options.rivetsDelimiters`
        * `options.rivetsFormatters`
        * `options.rivetsPrefix`
    * rivets formatters and binders are now called with the scope of the view
    * can set Rivets template delimiters using `options.rivetsDelimiters`
    * plugin methods are now called with the options (and still the context of the view)
* bug fixes
    * the rivets plugin no longer `this.model.set('viewId', this.cid)` for the view
    * `rivetsFormatters` and `rivetsBinders` no longer have to be stored on the view and are consumed from `options` in initialize
    * the rivet view allows configuration of whether to run the rivets plugin using whether `options.rivetsConfig` (or `options.rivetConfig`) is truthy or falsey.
    * choosing not to include a wrapper div is no longer supported, since it can lead to some confusing gotchas if there are more than one root level elements in your template.
